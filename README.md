# Salary Analysis
This project analyzes salary data from the dataset (salaries.csv). It includes data processing steps such as adding benchmark salaries, computing salary scores, and modifying the dataset using Python and Pandas.
# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Ensure the following is installed:
  * Python.
  * Pandas, Numpy (used to analyze the data).
  # Installing 
  * Download a copy of the repository to your local machine git clone  https://github.com/your-username/Salary_Analysis.git
  * Go to the project directories: Salary Analysis.
  * Install the required libraries: pip install pandas numpy.  
# Running the Analysis
  * Open the Jupiter Notebook file (Lab 2 Test).
  * Execute the initial cell to import all required libraries (Pandas, Numpy).
  * Execute the second cell to load the dataset (salaries.csv).
  * The next steps will process the data. After which, a new column Benchmarks was added with a constant value of 70000 and another new column Salary score was calculated as the ratio of salary to Benchmarks.
  * Execute all steps to perform full analysis.
# Breakdown of Tests
  * The script analyzes salary distribution based on factors such as rank, gender, and discipline, among others.
  * Two new columns were created Benchmanrks (to compare individual salaries against a standardized baseline) and Salary Score (to quantifies how much higher or lower each salary is compared to the benchmark).
# Deployment
  This project is intended to be run locally in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
